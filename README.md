# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

Project Name: Spots Web Page

Project Description: The idea of this project was to demonstrate how to build and design a basic website that can be viewed in multiple ways-from the desktop to the tablet to the mobile phone, which I was able to do by using new code commands including the MEDIA QUERY; and also a bevy of technologies including Figma, DOT AI, and VS CODE editor.

As far as improving the project, perhaps a bit more background on the topics being covered, as Bessie Coleman is a fantastically impressive person but I did not see any relationship between her and other pictures that were being used in this example. I know that the website is not going to be used but still, I am sure there was some more information we could have used just to offer a better conceptual idea for the website. That is probably going to be addressed in the next stage but a little more basic inforomation would have been an improvement.
